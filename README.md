# World Editor for <a href="https://github.com/thalesmariiano/Shoot-And-Slash">Shoot And Slash</a>

I created this map editor for make the shoot and slash development more easy. But, i like too much this.

After save the map, you will receive a json file with a tileset array like that:

> (but, not formated like that)
```json
[
  {
    "width":50,
    "height":50,
    "imgX":0,
    "imgY":0,
    "position": {
        "x":50,
        "y":500
    },
    "type":"Block",
    "visible":false
  }
]
```
